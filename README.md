# Fortran-Library-for-Material-Constitutive-Models
This library has a lot of Fortran Routines for model implicit material constitutive behavior. There are implementation of Neo-Hooken, Odgen and Hencky potential for hyperelastic behavior.
Also the viscoplastic Perzyna potential is implement. All these routines were used in my master thesis, which I implement a hyperelastic-viscoplastic  constitutive model.
This is a very used library if you intend to implement a constitutive model in Ansys Mechanical. Then you can modify your usermat.f in other to incorpared behavior and function present in this library.
