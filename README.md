# Fortran-Library-for-Material-Constitutive-Models
This library has a lot of Fortran Routines for model implicit material constitutive behavior. There are implementation of Neo-Hooken, Odgen and Hencky potential for hyperelastic behavior.
Also the viscoplastic Perzyna potential is implement. All these routines were used in my master thesis, which I implement a hyperelastic-viscoplastic  constitutive model.
This is a very used library if you intend to implement a constitutive model in Ansys Mechanical. Then you can modify your usermat.f in other to incorpared behavior and function present in this library.
It contains functions to deviatoric and volumetic decomposition, eigenvalue and eingen vector decompostion. There are some stress conversion as well, for instance the Cauchy stress to 1st Piola-Kirshoff stress, Kirshoff stress to 2nd Piola Kirshoof stress and so on. This is very useful because the model may be created with any stress measure and then converted to the formulation of Ansys solver, which is a rotated Rotated Cauchy Stress.
